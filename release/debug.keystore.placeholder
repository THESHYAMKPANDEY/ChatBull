# This is a placeholder for the Android keystore
# In a real scenario, you would generate a proper keystore using:
# keytool -genkeypair -v -storetype JKS -keystore release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# For production, never commit the actual keystore file to version control
# This file is just a placeholder to show where it would go
